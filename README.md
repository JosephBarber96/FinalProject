#### Delaunay triangulation

(Essentially the inverse of voronoi diagrams - only really worth implementing one of the two)

#### L-Systems

#### Fractals

#### Perlin Noise

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise

#### Shape grammars
These may be useful

## Misc and Helpful links

Procedural City Generation: http://www.tmwhere.com/city_generation.html
I like this above post because it uses many of the ideas that I already had, such as using noise to generate your own population desntiy maps. I would enjoy building a similar implementation however would like to improve upon it by also introducing water boundary maps and having my roads adjust accordingly.
