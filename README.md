Procedural City Generation: http://www.tmwhere.com/city_generation.html
I like this above post because it uses many of the ideas that I already had, such as using noise to generate your own population desntiy maps. I would enjoy building a similar implementation however would like to improve upon it by also introducing water boundary maps and having my roads adjust accordingly.
