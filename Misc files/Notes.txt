Road Networks:

	L-systems:

		Input is taken in the form of 2D image maps
		
			-Geographical information:
				-Elevation, vegetation and water boundaries
					-These are required.
					
			-Socio statictal image maps can be included:
				-Population density, land usage, street pattern and maximum building heights
					-These are optional
					
			-Extra user parameters:
				-Smoothing angle of road network edges, road width, edges
					-Also optional
					
					
		Road generation is accomplished through 2 rule sets:
		
			Road segments are initially plotted according to the global goals which are 
			similar to the goals that a city designer may have. These tentative plans are 
			then refined by the local constraints which reflect the practical constaints
			of the real world and the state of the existing road network
		
			Global goals:
				
				-There are two types of roads:
					
					-Highways or major roads:
						-Connect poplation density centres which can be identified from the population
						density map supplied at input
						
					-Small roads:
						-Connect at the nearest highways
						
				-Streets follow some super imposed geometic pattern
				
				-Streets follow the path of least elevation
			
			Local constraints:
			
				-Road segments are pruned to fit inside the legal area/land
				
				-Roads are rotated to fit inside the legal area/land
				Coastline roads bend around the coastlines like a coastal road
				
				-Highways are allowed to cross illegal area (water etc.) if it is a certain distance
				this makes it a bridge
				
				-Road segments are checked to see if they intersect with existing roads or if they come within 
				a certain distance of an existing road junction before finishing the roads.
