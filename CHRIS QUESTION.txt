Hello,

I have a question about my final project (An investigation into techniques for procedurally generating 
realistic cities).

My brief outline of work says that
"I will be prototyping multiple techniques for procedural city generation. 
This will include techniques for road generation such as L-systems and template-based 
generation, techniques for terrain generation such as noise or mid-point displacement, 
and if time allows it, techniques for procedural building generation such as shape 
grammars and fractals."

I am just asking to see if I will be responsible for creating my own implementation 
of all of these techniques or if I can make use of an existing implementation. 

I ask this as I have spent this week looking into Voronoi Diagrams and have 
found many existing algorithms and implementations. As for noise, I imagine 
that I would use an existing library for creating noise and then it would be 
my responsibility to use this appropriately within my city generation. Likewise, 
I am asking about using an existing implementation of Voronoi Diagrams and similar 
algorithms and then using this within my city generation (ensuring all lines abide 
to global and local constraints, etc). I ask this because I underestimated the work 
required to implement each of these algorithms and will have to rescope my project 
to allow time to create unique implementations. 

Many Thanks,
Joseph.
